# Uncertainties-and-Controversies-in-the-recent-NFT-boom-using-SQL

The future of NFTs is unclear as many of the NFTs turned out to be scams of sorts since the field is wildly unregulated. They’re also contested heavily for their impact on the environment.
 
Regardless of these controversies, it is clear that there is money to be made in NFTs. One cool part about NFTs is that all of the data is recorded on the blockchain, meaning anytime something happens to an NFT, it is logged in this database. 
 
In this project, I explored and analyzed real-world NFT data. 
That data set is a sales data set of one of the most famous NFT projects, Cryptopunks. Meaning each row of the data set represents a sale of an NFT. The data includes sales from January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2021. The table has several columns including the buyer address, the ETH price, the price in U.S. dollars, the seller’s address, the date, the time, the NFT ID, the transaction hash, and the NFT name.
In this project, I explored the recent NFT boom, high transactions, uncertainties, and controversies, while recognizing their appeal for transparent, blockchain-based recording and potential profits.
